# Vr Sandbox Playground
Me, myself, and I.
## Goal for game
   I intend to make a Vr sandbox game that will allow the player to select from a menu of various objects that can be altered in both size and color, the player will then be able to place these objects into the game world to create whatever they wish to, the game will allow the player to navigate the game area by using the controllers right joystick and the left controller buttons will be responsible for rotating, selecting, and altering the color of objects.

## Stretch Goals:
   If I have enough time I would really like to impliment a few physics items for the player to interact with, this would include a ball, bat, and hopefully a glass pane that shatters when an object with enough velocity collides with it.

## Other ideas include: 
- a grapple gun that will pull the player towards whatever the grapple connects with, which would allow for a player to craft a fun obstical course.
- A ball cannon that will fire a physics ball on a set interval
- A box that will break when enough "force" is applied (most likely will just be another velocity calculation)
- A spray paint can that will allow the player to more freely color objects after they have been placed into the play area

## Tech to be used:
- Unity(C#)
- Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit specifically the Oculus Integration toolkit
    For hardware I will be using my Oculus Quest in developer mode, which will allow me to run my program as intended.

## Plan of attack
   I intned to spend the first day or so just researching how to use C# and getting my project set up in Unity, then jump into the process of adding different objects for the player to put into the game environment. In terms of how I plan to actually learn the technologies, I plan to scour the documentation and watch tons of Youtube tutorials until I feel comfortable to create my own unique aspects of the game. 

## Potential Roadblocks
   Seeing as I am not at all familiar with Unity there very well could be a few issues wit h implementing some of the features that I want to such as the physics objects and or the spray paint can, I will see as I start working more what is and is not possible in the time that I have.

## Who is this game for?
   Honestly this game is mostly for me, but I wouldn't be against putting it out on the internet if it doesn't turn out to be hot garbage. The reason that I chose this concept is that currently I have been unable to find a game that has both physics objects and a sandbox focus, The only games I have come across are either or. I have a game that allows me to place various objects into a play area, but player movement is very limited and there is no interaction between what you make and anything else.
   On the other hand there a quite a few physics playgrounds out for people to play, but all of the objects are already in the world and you are just left to play with what the dev put into the small area so there is little replay value. I intent to incorporate both so that the player has much more freedom with what they choose to do inside of the play area.
